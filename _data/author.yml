  <p>
I’m a Computer Games Technology graduate from the University of Portsmouth, specializing in game development
with a strong technical foundation. I enjoy building gameplay systems, experimenting with mechanics, and tackling
design challenges.<br>

<br>I have experience working with Unreal Engine, C++, and Blueprint scripting, focusing on creating engaging 
and interactive experiences. My portfolio consists of projects that recreate existing gameplay styles along 
with original works.<br>

<br>Beyond development, I enjoy problem-solving, learning new skills, and refining my craft. I'm always looking
for opportunities to grow as a developer and contribute to exciting projects in the industry.
